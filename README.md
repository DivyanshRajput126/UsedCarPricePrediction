# UsedCarPricePrediction
This project focused on predicting used car prices using machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging a Random Forest Regressor with RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization to enhance prediction accuracy.
# Key Features
**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared real-world used car datasets by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted detailed EDA to uncover trends and correlations, such as the impact of mileage, age, and fuel type on car prices.
**Feature Engineering**: Enhanced the dataset by creating derived features like car age and log-transformed variables to improve model efficiency.
**Model Development**: Trained a Random Forest Regressor for its robustness and ability to handle feature interactions. Used RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters such as the number of estimators, max depth, and min samples split, optimizing model performance.
**Evaluation and Testing**: Assessed model accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R^2, achieving high predictive accuracy.
